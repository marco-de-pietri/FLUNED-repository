# FLUNED-SL

FLUNED-SL is a tool to calculate and generate a computational model of the
radiation source generated by the flow of an activated fluid through an
arbitrarily complex pipe circuit. The tool is based on the Monte Carlo sampling
of the circuit path. The program generate a CDGS source that can be run in the
D1SUNED code and a vtk file for visualization and post-processing. At the moment
it can simulate steady-states and transients and more features are being implemented.

# Usage

The program requires a set of files that describe the pipe topology, the radioisotopes entering the circuit and the reaction rates. Examples of the file format describing the circuit can be found in the test folder or generated automatically with SpaceClaim scripts that can be provided by the author.

An input template for running fluned_sl can be generated with the command:
```
fluned_sl -t
```

Once all the input files are present the simulation is run with the command:

```
fluned_sl -i input_file
```

# Tests

the test folder contain a set of tests to check the proper working of the different features by launching from the main folder the command:
```
pytest -v test
```
